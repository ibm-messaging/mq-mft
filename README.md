# IBM MQ Managed File Transfer 

This repository is the place for IBM MQ Managed File Transfer Exits that can be used for customizing the transfers. It is also place for "How To" documents, tips etc.

## 1. Delete Files Exit
There could be multiple files, like all files in a directory, are to be transferred as part of one transfer request. When such a transfer request is submitted, it's possible that some of the files in the transfer request are successfully transferred and some fail to transfer
for some reason. In such a case, the transfer is marked partial successful. If the transfer request specified "source_file_disposition" as "delete" (i.e. -sd delete), then the files which were transferred successfully are deleted at source and the files that failed to 
transfer are left as it is.

Since the transfer was partially successful, the user submits the reuest again to transfer the remaining files. But this request fails as some of the files have been transferred in the previous attempt and were deleted. 
  
This sample SourceTransferEndExit exit deletes the files after a transfer is completed successfully. Files are not deleted if for some reason transfer fails or partially complete.

## 2. Filter File Exit
Assume a there are a number of files in directory and user wants to transfer only those files whose size matches a certain value. For example user wants transfer only files whose size is between 10 and 12 mega bytes.
  
When a transfer is initiated, an agent would pick all files in the directory and transfer, no matter what the size of file is. With this exit, the agent would transfer only those files that match specified size.

## 3. Archive Files Exit
There are scenarios where it is required to archive the files in a source directory and move to a different place. ArchiveFiles exit extends the MFT functionality by providing the ability to archive files at source agent. The files at source agent are archived as zip file and copied to a folder.

The path where the zip file is created can be specified using "ARCHIVE_PATH" key in transfer metadata. If the value specified to "ARCHIVE_PATH" points to a directory, then the zip file will be created in that directory with "archive<Current time in millisecond>.zip name, for example "archive123445858.zip". If the value points to a file, then a zip file with that name will be created. If "ARCHIVE_PATH" key is not specified, then the path of the first file in the transfer list will be used to create the zip file.

## 4. Archive files at source using Ant script
Archiving files at source or destination endpoint after files are transferred is a task customers often use. IBM MQ Managed File Transfer provides few options to archive files;
 1) Custom exits 
 2) Call programs, JCL, Ant scripts

While usage of custom Java exit has been discussed in #3 above, here we discuss about using an Ant script to archive files at source endpoint after a transfer completes. 

The Ant script here (https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-mft/blob/master/mft.ant/arch.xml) uses the Zip task to archive files at source folder. The script is simple and self explanatory. It requires two parameters to passed, name of the source folder `SRCFLDR` from where files will be picked up for archiving and absolute path of target archive file, `ARCHPATH`.

Follow the steps below to make use of the script.
1) Create a folder of your choice, say '/usr/mft/scripts' and copy the script into that folder.

2) Update the agent.properties file of the source MFT agent and the following:
   `commandPath=/usr/mft/scripts`
   
   Agent uses tThe commandPath property to locate the scripts and run them as part of transfer.

3) Restart source agent.

4) Initiate a transfer using fteCreateTransfer command, for example

`fteCreateTransfer -rt -1 -sa SRCAGNT -sm SRCQM -da DSTAGNT -dm DSTQM -postsrc "antscript:arch.xml(ARCHPATH=/usr/mft/arhive1.zip,SRCFLDR=/usr/srcfldr),,,0" -r -de overwrite -dd "/usr/dest" "/usr/srcfldr"`


## 5. Rename destination file based on MQMD attribute.
IBM MQ Managed File Transfer can be used for transferring files from one point to another point in a MQ network. Apart from moving files, MFT can also move messages from a queue and write them as files at the destination i.e. Message-to-File transfer. MFT can also do File to Message transfer.

The Message-to-File transfer helps in integrating applications in solution where one application generates it's output as messages but the next application in the solution that needs process the information contained in the messages does not have the capability to handle messages as it requires input to be in files. 

There can be scenarios where, in a Message-to-File transfer, the name of the destination file is required to be generated dynamically and is controlled by attribute on the first message. Typically a message propertis and variable substitution technique is used for this purpose as described in the link below:

     http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_7.5.0/com.ibm.wmqfte.doc/m2f_mon_variable.htm

However there can be cases where a legacy applications putting messages to a queue does not have ability to set message properties. The application can set MQMD attributes though. Because of this the destination file name can't be dynamically controlled and set by the sender. This exit (and combination with accompanying RenameFile exit) helps in such scenario.

## 6. Update source files list 
The goal of this exit is to demonstrate how to update source file list. The exit searches the source directory for matching file names but with a different extension. For example if the source file specified by the create transfer request was dailytranactions.xml, then exit would search for dailytranactions.csv  dailytranactions.pdf etc and add to transfer list.

The second and important aim of this exit is to demonstrate how to set the Source and Destination metadata for the files which are added to source file list. Setting source and destination metadata controls, for example, whether the source file is deleted after file is transffered or the destination file is overwritten if one already exists.

## 7. Many to one file transfer using Ant script
There can be scenario wherein many files present at source end need to be transferred as one single file at destination. Basically after the first file is transferred, content of rest of the files is appended to the first file. In IBM MQ Managed File Transfer, files are transferred individually i.e. if there are three files in source end, then all three files are transferred separately and there will be three files at destination end. Appending file content to an existing file is not possible. However it's possible to use a combination of two transfers to do this job.

## 8. Move files from source folder at the end of a transfer.
I was working recently with a customer who had the following requirement in their file transfer solution:
At source agent 
1) move files from source to directory to a directory which they called ARCHIVE directory if transfer succeeds.
2) move files from source to directory to a directory which they called REJECT directory if transfer fails.

This requirement can be easily met by implementing a class of SourceTransferEndExit interface as described in the sample here.
https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-mft/blob/master/mft.samples/src/mft/samples/MoveFiles.java

## 9. Append file
This package contains two exits that helps in appending data to an existing file instead of the standard MFT behavior of either throwing an error if file exists or overwriting if -de option in fteCreateTransfer is set to overwrite.
See the explanation in the code for usage details.

## 10. Manage IBM MQ MFT Using Python Scripts
Starting with IBM MQ v9.1, administrators can manage Managed File Transfer (MFT) using REST APIs.
The IBM MQ MFT REST Python Samples repository demonstrates how to use these APIs via Python scripts. These samples are particularly useful for automating MFT operations or integrating MFT capabilities into custom tools and dashboards.

The repository includes scripts to:

1) Initiate transfers between agents
2) Monitor specific or all transfers
3) Filter transfers by agent, status, or file prefix
4) Summarize successful, pending, and failed transfers
5) Create and query resource monitors for filesystem tracking

## 11. Visualize MFT status through Prometheus
This application enables real-time monitoring of IBM MQ Managed File Transfer (MFT) by subscribing to the SYSTEM.FTE topic on the coordination queue manager. It captures various MFT status messages — such as transfer status, agent activity, and monitor events — originally published in complex XML format.

These messages are parsed and converted into simplified Json structures, making them easier to process and analyze. The Json data is then pushed to Prometheus Pushgateway, allowing Prometheus to scrape it and Grafana to visualize transfer metrics via customizable dashboards.

By transforming MFT monitoring data into Json, this tool improves observability, enables easier integration with modern monitoring stacks, and facilitates better tracking of file transfers, agent health, and system status.
